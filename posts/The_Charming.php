					The Charming Arrogance of Robert Downey, Jr. Reduced To His 10 Best Quotes</h2>
				<img alt="Images of Robert Downey Jr." src="celebrityb2.jpg" title="Robert Downey Jr." /><br />
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;">
					I saw an interview with Robert Downey, Jr. -- who is already starting his promotional tour for Iron Man 3 -- over on Moviefone today, where he was referred to as the Greatest Actor of the Generation</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;" style="color: rgb(48, 48, 48); font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1px; line-height: 24px;">
					I saw an interview with Robert Downey, Jr. -- who is already starting his promotional tour for&nbsp;<i>Iron Man 3</i>&nbsp;-- over on&nbsp;<a href="http://news.moviefone.com/2013/04/16/robert-downey-jr-oscar_n_3092325.html" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(139, 0, 0); text-decoration: none;">Moviefone</a>&nbsp;today, where he was referred to as the Greatest Actor of the Generation. In typically Downey fashion, he didn&#39;t deny it, but he still managed to be arrogant and self-effacing at the same time: &quot;It&#39;s not like this is the greatest swath or generation of actors that has ever come down the pike,&quot; he said.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;" style="color: rgb(48, 48, 48); font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1px; line-height: 24px;">
					That&#39;s Robert Downey, Jr., who is certainly&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;of the greatest [lead] actors of his generation. But he also gives great quote. When you&#39;ve been in the business as long as he has, and when you&#39;ve hit rock bottom a couple of times, spent some days in jail, woke up in stranger&#39;s houses, and made it all the way back to the top, where he&#39;s earning $50 million for&nbsp;<i>Iron Man</i>, you&#39;ve earned the right to some arrogance. And to speak your mind honestly.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;" style="color: rgb(48, 48, 48); font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1px; line-height: 24px;">
					Anyway, I dug throughs some old Robert Downey, Jr. quotes -- which is a great way to spend your morning, actually -- and I came up with my ten favorite as something of a refresher course of Downey&#39;s arrogant charm. We&#39;re going to be seeing a lot of it over the next month, and that is totally OK with me. (I also love that he talks sh*t about Hugh Grant, confirming&nbsp;<a href="http://gawker.com/5968373/jon-stewart-confirms-what-seemed-obvious-hugh-grant-is-a-dick" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(139, 0, 0); text-decoration: none;">Jon Stewart&#39;s opinion of Grant</a>: That he&#39;s a huge dick.)</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;" style="color: rgb(48, 48, 48); font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 1px; line-height: 24px;">
					<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On whether he&#39;ll win an Oscar: &quot;As long as I stick around I&#39;m going to end up with a bunch of them anyway as they&#39;re going to run out of people to give them to. And I&#39;m probably going to win it one year when someone else deserves to win it. Why? Because it&#39;s my time, goddamit. And that&#39;s the way sh*t works around here. I&#39;m just an uptight mutt at the top of his game. Welcome to Hollywood, bitch! I&#39;ll see you at the Vanity Fair party and I&#39;ll be holding that golden statue you deserve &#39;cause guess what? It happened to me too!&quot;</span></p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;">On having not won an Oscar yet: &quot;I, personally, would be shocked if we went to the end of the tape now and I didn&#39;t have at least one... Look, even if I don&#39;t get one directly, eventually they&#39;re just going to have to give me one when I get old. So no matter how you slice it, I&#39;m getting one.</p>&quot;

							<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;I&#39;ve become a picky little bitch. I&#39;ve never bothered to plan projects before. I just used to throw the script across the room and say, &quot;Why do they keep sending me this horseshit?&quot; And then I&#39;d start rehearsals two weeks later.&quot;</span></p>

							<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;Tofu is the root of all evil, and there&#39;s only one thing that can change a man&#39;s mind, and that&#39;s a modified Uzi with an extra-long clip.&quot;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;I did&nbsp;</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">Air America</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;for two reasons: to be in a movie with Mel Gibson and to make a bunch of money. And then underneath there was the hope that in doing this formulaic thing I would be launched into a whole new realm of opportunity to do A-list movies. By the time we were done, the only positive thing was meeting Mel Gibson.&quot;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On Hugh Grant, with whom he worked on 1995&#39;s&nbsp;</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">Restoration</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: &quot;I just thought he was a dick, that&#39;s all. And I still do. You know, and that could be something that has to do with me, or it could just be that not everyone in this industry is someone I&#39;d care to hang out with.</span></p>

							<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;">I defecated in [Kelly LeBrock&#39;s] trailer, much to the chagrin of Bill Paxton and Robert Rusler. It was a real bad scene. Joel Silver freaked. I never admitted it. Joel said, &quot;Downey, did you do it?&quot; and I said I wish I had. Because I&#39;d been threatening everyone that if they didn&#39;t treat me right, I was going to take a dump in their trailer, or that I&#39;d go take a shit in Joel&#39;s office, on his desk or something.&quot;</p></span></p>

						&quot;<p  style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;">As soon as I started smoking heroin instead of smoking coke, everything was different, and I knew it was. And it happened around the time I was doing &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;. Home for the Holidays is, for me, one of the most relaxed performances in the history of cinema. I can&#39;t attribute that to the fact that I was at a serene place in my life, or that there was a real warm feeling on the set. This is a problem for me because I glamorize this stuff. I can&#39;t say that it wasn&#39;t real dark, real evil and real hurtful to those around me. And yet, practically every take of that film was a print. God bless Jodie Foster. When does she have time to do a handwritten letter telling someone how she genuinely cares about them? She said, &quot;Listen, I&#39;m not worried about you on this film. You&#39;re not losing it or nodding out, and you&#39;re giving a great performance. I&#39;m worried about your thinking you can get away with doing this on another film.</p>&quot;

							<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On&nbsp;</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">U.S. Marshals</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: &quot;Possibly the worst action movie of all time, and that&#39;s just not good for the maintenance of a good spiritual condition. You&#39;ve had a traumatic year, you&#39;ve been practically suicidal -- what do you think would be really healing for you? How about like twelve weeks of running around as Johnny Handgun? I think that if you talk to a spirit guide, they would say, &#39;That&#39;ll kill you.&#39; ... I thought maybe there was something I was missing, and what I really needed to do was to be in one of those films that I love taking my kid to. It would end up being really depressing. I&#39;d rather wake up in jail for a TB test than have to wake up another morning knowing I&#39;m going to the set of&nbsp;</span><em style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">US Marshals</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.&quot;</span></p>

							<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;Shall I tell you the joys of the Jetta station wagon, dude? It&#39;s low-profile. It&#39;s got it all. The instrumentation, while firmly rooted in the twenty-first century, could easily be mistaken for 1993. The steering wheel has nothing but the steering wheel ... The funny thing is, Susan&#39;s and my lifestyle -- as much as it&#39;s about home and creating something warm -- it&#39;s still an image thing no matter how you slice it, the same way it&#39;s as much of an ego trip to drive the Jetta as it is the Bentley. One&#39;s a judgment on the other, and one&#39;s a counterjudgment, and God bless the Prius, but that ain&#39;t me.&quot;</span></p>
