						<h2>Cameron Dallas Explains the Beauty-Related Reason Why He Fell Down</h2>
					<img src="beautyd2.jpg" alt="Images of Carrie Fisher" title="Images of Carrie Fisher"><br/><br/>
						Cameron Dallas is known for being totally honest with his fans and when he had an embarrassing moment, he just had to let everyone know. The Vine star was simply engaging in his usual skincare routine and he had a total mishap. Poor guy fell!<br/>
						Cam wiped out when he walked back into his bathroom after grabbing his face wash, and since he tweeted about it, poking some fun at himself, it's safe to say he's doing just fine. Even if he suffered through some pain, at least his face is nice and clean. Upside.
