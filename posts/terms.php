		<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">
			16. Arbitration For any dispute you have with Company, you agree to first contact us and make a good faith, sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution. If Company has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement by binding arbitration as set forth below. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 USD, the parties agree to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (&ldquo;ADR&rdquo;) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 USD or more, the parties agree to resolve the dispute through by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Company will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including but not limited to matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to or use of the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES&rsquo; INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Furthermore, you agree that any cause of action must commence within one (1) year after the underlying issue first arose, otherwise you waive any right to bring such cause of action and it is permanently barred.</p>
