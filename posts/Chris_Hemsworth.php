						Well, I’ll tell you what kind of world it would be – a much, much duller place if Chris Hemsworth decided to retire from the public eye. So let’s hope he’s just being humble.In an interview with Parade magazine, Hemsworth was musing about how it could all end at any moment (as IF). He told the mag, “I don’t want to have to be in the position where I care if the phone stops ringing. I’m OK about potentially not acting. That just may be me trying to convince myself in case it does happen, but I’ve always been weirdly aware of that.”<br/><br/>
						Okay, like I said, he’s being pragmatic about it but in no way will his phone ever stop ringing. Please. Even Saturday Night Live spoofed how ridiculously easy this gorgeous man has had it. Sure, he’s Thor, but Chris has put a lot of humor and heart into that Avenging Norse god, so he’s got the chops.<br/><br/></p>

We’d leave the house and there would be six paparazzi out in front. In L.A., more than anywhere else in the world, paparazzi are everywhere, 24/7. We felt suffocated. The agitation you feel from the paparazzi rippled in the house.<br/>He now lives about “an hour and a half outside of Melbourne… it’s just a quiet little surf town with a lot of farming.”Judging from some of Elsa’s Instagram snaps, it’s also idyllic.
