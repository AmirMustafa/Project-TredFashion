						MARS’ nickname the Red Planet may no longer be appropriate after NASA made a landmark discovery when drilling into its surface.<br/><br/>

						BLUE dust has been found within Mars by NASA's Curiosity rover 4WD droid, which has been exploring the planet for 40 months.

As it carried out sampling on “buckskin” rocks in the Mount Sharp area of the planet, the drill found a rare mineral and disturbed the blue dust.

Much of Mars, beneath the immediate red surface, which is thought to be a rust deposited by volcanoes, has been found to be a pale blue.

During the sampling, the rover uncovered something that has never ever been detected on Mars before and is rare on Earth - tridymite.<br/><br/>

The mineral could be a clue for NASA scientists in determining Mars suspected volcanic past, that would have made it a lot like Earth when it was also covered in lakes and seas billions of years ago.

The usual origin of tridymite on Earth involves high temperatures in igneous or metamorphic rocks, but the finely layered sedimentary rocks examined by Curiosity have been interpreted as lakebed deposits. 

Tridymite is found in volcanic deposits with high silica content. 

Rocks on Mars' surface generally have less silica, like basalts in Hawaii, though some silica-rich rocks have been found by Mars rovers and orbiters. <br/><br/>

A NASA spokesman said: "Magma, the molten source material of volcanoes, can evolve on Earth to become silicic. Tridymite found at Buckskin may be evidence for magmatic evolution on Mars."<br/><br/><br/>

						The rover has also found much higher concentrations of silica at some sites it has investigated in the past seven months than anywhere else it has visited since landing on Mars. <br/><br/>

Silica makes up nine-tenths of the composition of some of the rocks. 

It is a rock-forming chemical combining the elements silicon and oxygen, commonly seen on Earth as quartz, but also in many other minerals.

Albert Yen, a Curiosity science team member at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, said: "These high-silica compositions are a puzzle. You can boost the concentration of silica either by leaching away other ingredients while leaving the silica behind, or by bringing in silica from somewhere else.<br/><br/>

"Either of those processes involve water. If we can determine which happened, we'll learn more about other conditions in those ancient wet environments."</p><br/><br/>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">Water that is acidic would tend to carry other ingredients away and leave silica behind. Alkaline or neutral water could bring in dissolved silica that would be deposited from the solution. <br/><br/>

Apart from presenting a puzzle about the history of the region where Curiosity is working, the recent findings on Mount Sharp have intriguing threads linked to what an earlier NASA rover, Spirit, found halfway around Mars. <br/><br/>
