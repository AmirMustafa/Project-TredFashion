			Like the red lip, a shiny crimson manicure is a classic with which you can&#39;t go wrong. From dramatic blood red to fiery poppy or ruby hues, there&#39;s a shade for every season, occasion, and individual skin tone. But as MAC&#39;s Ruby Woo and Nars Heatwave have proven for lips, there are always those colors that come out on top as cult favorites in their category &mdash; and red nail enamel is no exception. Rank &amp; Style, a site that uses a unique algorithm to generate top ten lists for beauty and fashion buys, has released its lineup of the best scarlet lacquers on the market. Leading the pack is &#39;Big Apple Red&#39; by OPI, a perfectly pigmented version that&#39;s as iconic as its namesake city, followed Butter London&#39;s tomatoey-red &#39;Ladybird&#39; in second place and Essie&#39;s universally flattering &#39;Really Red&#39;, in third.</p>
