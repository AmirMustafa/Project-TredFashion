						Leave it to our July cover star Cara Delevingne to up the ante on her own chic take on rock star style. The model and actress has always demonstrated a penchant for band jackets, flirty frocks, and retro shades but last night in London, en route with Suki Waterhouse and Clara Paget to the Strokes concert, the 22-year-old put a fresh twist on her Sgt. Pepper look.<br/><br/>


Delevingne wore Saint Laurent’s sleek blazer trimmed with gold buttons for added pop and a militaristic influence, but it was her Bee Line x Timberland grass-print boots designed by Pharrell Williams that stole the show. They’ll be perfect for an outdoor concert too: What better to wear in the field than the field itself? With the Glastonbury Festival kicking off next week, we think Delevingne has found her new sole mate.
