						<br/>The star dishes on her "terrible brothers" who would torment her for being a female while growing up<br/>
						Jennifer Lawrence has revealed she grew up in a house where it was "an offence" to be "considered a female".<br/><br/>

						The Oscar-winning actress has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and grew up in a sporty household in Louisville, Kentucky.<br/><be/>

						During her appearance on The Graham Norton Show, the Joy star said: "It was actually an offence in the house to be considered a female.<br/><br/>

						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;"><br/>PAAt least JLaw can laugh about it now!
"They were terrible and would say things like, 'You are such a girl' or 'Don't do that, that's what a girl would do.' I'm only now getting used to being called a female."<br/>

Since becoming famous, Lawrence, 25, has frequently expressed outrage at the way female stars are treated - speaking out after naked photos were leaked online, and penning a furious essay after discovering her male co-stars were paid more highly.<br/>

Lawrence, who appears on the December 31 edition of the show, also told Graham Norton that she hated New Year's Eve.</p><br/><br/>

					<br/><p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">She said: "I really hate it. I've never had a good one - everyone's chasing a good time and it's always a disappointment."I plan on doing nothing and then if something lands in my lap... but I always end up drunk and disappointed."She joked: "'Drunk and Disappointed' should be the title of my memoir!"</p><br/><br/>

					<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">The actress also opened up about her tendency to throw up, saying: "I am a puker. When I get stressed and exhausted I just vomit."I was driving with my publicist the other day and had to roll down the window and I puked all down the side of the car. It was in front of all the paparazzi - I painted New York! And I threw up at Madonna's party - on the porch!"Lawrence was "discovered" when she was scouted as a model at the age of 14 while visiting New York with her family.</p><br/><br/>

					<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">But she said: "You'll never see the pictures I did for Abercrombie and Fitch. They wanted natural pictures so they made us play football on the beach. The other models played football in a pretty way but not me! My face was bright red and I was sweaty with flaring nostrils. One of the girls even yelled, 'Get her away from me!'<br/>"And, when my agent asked why the pictures hadn't been used, their only response was to send the pictures... you won't see them in a store for sure!"</p>
