					<h2>5 predictions about the future of work Bill Gates nailed in 2005 — and 2 we wish he had</h2>

					<p id="post_para">
						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">On May 19, 2005, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates released a company-wide memo simply titled "The New World of Work." <br/>
						In it, Gates outlined some of the tectonic shifts people could expect to see in their office spaces over the next 10 years. 
						Not all of the predictions came true — we don't all use software that recognizes when we're swamped and filters out distractions automatically — but he got a surprising amount right.</p><br/><br/>

						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;"><h3>Software helps us be more productive.</h3></p><br/>
						<img src="celebrityf4.jpg" alt="Images of Bill Gates"><br/>
						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">"New software will learn from the way you work, understand your needs, and help you set priorities," Gates wrote.<br/>
						Apps like Workflow and Evernote, and countless others, help increase productivity without requiring any manual programming.People can tell the app just once to call an Uber or send an email on certain days, and our apps can take care of them indefinitely, freeing us up to get more work done.</p><br/>

						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;"><h3>Our communication systems are (nearly) fully integrated.</h3></p><br/>
						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">Most of what we do nowadays is stored online, so it only makes sense for that information to be available how and when we need it.Apps like Slack and software like Siri integrate with our daily lives almost seamlessly, whether it's by eliminating email or satisfying our curiosity instantaneously.<br/> 
						We can send messages via voice-to-text and handle all forms of incoming messages — calls, emails, texts — all from the same device.</p><br/>
					
						<img src="celebrityf5.jpg" alt="Images of Bill Gates"><br/><br/>
						<p style="text-align: justify; margin-right:120px;">We wish there were a way for our email to automatically shut off when we're deep in thought.Unfortunately, Gates' prediction that "if you're working on a high-priority memo under a tight deadline, for example, software should be able to understand this and only allow phone calls or e-mails from, say, your manager or a family member," hasn't been invented yet.The closest thing we have are manually controlled distraction blockers, but even those can be taken down in an intense moment of weakness.</p>
