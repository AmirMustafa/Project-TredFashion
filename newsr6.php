			The United States and Cuba said Friday that they will re-establish direct mail service between the two countries for the first time in more than a half century, the latest sign of thawing relations between the long-time adversaries.</p>
		<p style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 18px; font-family: Georgia; line-height: 1.8em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 24px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17); text-align: justify; margin-right: 120px;">
			In separate statements, the State Department and the Cuban embassy in Washington said the agreement was reached Thursday during discussions in Miami. It calls for a pilot program to provide mail flights between the United States and Cuba, rather than routing mail through a third country as has been done for decades.</p>

			But the details remained sketchy. Though both sides agreed that the details will be finalized within several weeks, the Cuban statement said the two countries are still discussing unspecified &ldquo;technical, operational and safety aspects&rdquo; of expanded mail service. It also said both sides share &ldquo;the hope of eventually institutionalizing&rdquo; mail service &ldquo;on a permanent basis in the future.&rdquo; The U.S. statement only referred to the pilot program.</p>

			There was also a hint of the tensions that defined the U.S.-Cuban relationship since Fidel Castro &nbsp;came to power more than five decades ago and throughout the Cold War. An article from Cuba&rsquo;s official news service, Prensa Latina, said the Cuban delegation at Thursday&rsquo;s session with the United States &ldquo;presented several examples that prove the damages&rdquo; to the island nation from the ongoing U.S. economic embargo, a subject on which the U.S. and Cuba clashed as recently as October at the United Nations.</p>

			The State Department statement was notably brief, and U.S. officials declined to elaborate on any remaining issues between the two &nbsp;countries or provide details of what types of mail service will be resumed. The U.S. Postal Service issued a short statement saying it is &ldquo;pleased to participate in the historic direct transportation of mail service to Cuba beginning this month. The mail-related details are still being finalized.&rdquo;</p>
